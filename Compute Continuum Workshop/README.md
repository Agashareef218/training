# DECICE Compute Continuum Training Workshop

## Date
6th November 2023

## Overview
This workshop focuses on the compute continuum concept, covering its application areas, architectural challenges, and practical implementation techniques. Participants will gain hands-on experience in deploying workflows using containers across cloud and edge nodes.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the compute continuum concept and its selected application areas.
- Analyse the challenges associated with compute continuum architectures and their components.
- Implement a simple workflow using containers, deployed on both cloud and edge nodes.
